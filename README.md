## Database Configuration

TicketMe uses **PostgreSQL** for its database. The connection string is stored in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=TicketMeDB;Username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"
}

# How to Configure Your Database

1. Open **pgAdmin 4** and ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.  
2. Create a new database (e.g., `TicketMeDB`) if it does not exist.  
3. Open `appsettings.json` in Rider.  
4. Replace placeholders with your credentials:  
   - `YOUR_DB_USERNAME` â†’ your PostgreSQL username  
   - `YOUR_DB_PASSWORD` â†’ your PostgreSQL password  
5. Save the changes. 

# Running the Application

1. Open the project in **JetBrains Rider**.  
2. Ensure the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correctly set.  
3. Apply migrations to create the database schema:  

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
Start the application:

Click the Run button in Rider, or

Use the terminal:

bash
dotnet run
Open a browser and navigate to: https://localhost:5001 (or the port shown in the console).
