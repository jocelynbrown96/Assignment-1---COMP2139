Database Configuration
TicketMe uses PostgreSQL for its database. The connection string is stored in appsettings.json:

json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=TicketMeDB;Username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"
}
How to configure your database
Open pgAdmin 4 and ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.

Create a new database (e.g., TicketMeDB) if it does not exist.

Open appsettings.json in Rider.

Replace placeholders with your credentials:

YOUR_DB_USERNAME â†’ your PostgreSQL username

YOUR_DB_PASSWORD â†’ your PostgreSQL password

Save the changes.

Running the Application
Open the project in JetBrains Rider.

Ensure the connection string in appsettings.json is correctly set.

Apply migrations to create the database schema:

bash
dotnet ef database update
Start the application:

Click the Run button in Rider, or

Use the terminal:

bash
dotnet run
Open a browser and navigate to: https://localhost:5001 (or the port shown in the console).
